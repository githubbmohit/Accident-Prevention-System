# Accident-Prevention-System
The proposed accident prevention system comprises various technologies. These  technologies are used to collect and analyse data from different sources to identify  potential hazards, predict future accidents, and provide real-time warnings to workers. 
Creating an Accident Prevention System Simulation in ROS and Gazebo:

Environment Setup:

Install ROS: Follow the official installation guide for your operating system: http://wiki.ros.org/Documentation
Install Gazebo: Download and install Gazebo from http://classic.gazebosim.org/download or use your package manager based on your OS.
Create a ROS Workspace:

Open a terminal and create a new ROS workspace:
mkdir accident_prevention_sim
cd accident_prevention_sim
roscore
Develop Vehicle Model (Gazebo Plugin):

Create a ROS package named vehicle_model.
Inside vehicle_model, develop a Gazebo plugin (vehicle.cpp) to define the vehicle's 3D model, sensors, and actuators.
Use Gazebo's SDF (Simulation Description Format) or C++ API to construct the model.
Include necessary sensors (LiDAR, IMU) and actuators (steering, braking) using Gazebo APIs.
Consider existing robot models in ROS repositories as a starting point (e.g., TurtleBot).
Create ROS Nodes for Sensors:

Create a ROS package named sensor_nodes.
Inside sensor_nodes, create ROS nodes for:
lidar_node.cpp (simulates LiDAR data for obstacle detection)
imu_node.cpp (simulates accelerometer data for accident detection)
Use ROS libraries like sensor_msgs and geometry_msgs for sensor data messages.
Simulate realistic sensor data based on Gazebo's physics engine.
Implementing custom logic for alcohol detection would require additional research and hardware integration beyond ROS.
Accident Detection and Response (ROS Node):

Create a ROS package named accident_detection.
Inside accident_detection, create a node (accident_detection_node.cpp) to process sensor data and trigger responses.
Subscribe to sensor nodes (lidar_node, imu_node) for data.
Implement logic to detect sudden changes in acceleration or proximity to obstacles using LiDAR data.
Upon accident detection, publish messages (e.g., accident_alert) to notify other nodes or simulations.
System Launch and Testing:

Create a launch file (launch/accident_prevention_sim.launch) to launch all nodes and the Gazebo simulation.
Configure dependencies between nodes in the launch file (e.g., sensors need to be launched before the accident detection node).
Start the ROS core (roscore) and launch the simulation using roslaunch launch/accident_prevention_sim.launch.
Observe the simulation in Gazebo and monitor the behavior of the system.
Test different accident scenarios by manipulating Gazebo's environment and vehicle controls.
Additional Considerations:

Driver Drowsiness Detection: Explore camera-based approaches (e.g., using OpenCV in a ROS node) for detecting drowsiness, but this requires significant development effort and training data.
Ethical and Legal Considerations: Engine control for drunk driving prevention raises ethical and legal concerns. Consider alternative approaches like warnings or system lockouts.
